<strong>WHAT HAPPEN</strong>:
Abstract from Shaha -
"The writer of puzzles often invents puzzles to illustrate a principle. The puzzles, however, sometimes have other ideas. They speak up and say that they would be so much prettier as slight variants of their original selves. The dilemma is that the puzzle inventor sometimes can't solve those variants. Sometimes he finds out that his colleagues can't solve them either, because there is no existing theory for solving them. At that point, these sassy variants deserve to be called upstarts. We discuss a few upstarts inspired originally from the Falklands/Malvinas Wars, zero-knowledge proofs, hikers in Colorado, and city planning. They have given a good deal of trouble to a certain mathematical detective who I know well."

<strong>Abstract: </strong>
Ratchets in fluid transportation and in biological locomotion
Dr. Zhang discussed several cases where a broken symmetry - either broken spontaneously or by construction - leads to ratcheting behavior in systems where dynamic boundaries interact with moving fluids. Two examples feature reciprocal forcing combined with geometric anisotropy of boundaries. In one case a solid body can be made to hover, and in another, a fluid is efficiently pumped. He will also discuss the dynamics of a symmetric wing whose "forward flight" follows from a symmetry breaking instability, and how this dynamics is affected by the introduction of more biological realism."

<em>Room 808 (Silver Center of Arts and Science)</em>
<em>Speaker:</em> Charles S. Peskin
<em>Abstract:</em>
This exciting talk is about a particular way of doing applied mathematics, by
computer simulation. The first step is to formulate equations of
motion: In this case a system of partial differential equations that
describe the motion of blood in the cardiac chambers driven by the
muscular heart walls and made unidirectional by the passive, elastic
heart valves. The next step is to devise a computational method, in
this case the immersed boundary method, to solve the equations of
motion. The last step is the computer simulation itself, which
generates an animation of the beating heart.

In particular, non-linear interactions between waves and turbulence as well as large-scale flow provide many open questions that affect our long-term environmental transformation, something that is surprisingly not very well understood. A background to the culture and Mathematics advancements made in the field of geophysical fluid dynamics, with many famous and important contributions made by Peter Lax and Courant, himself, will be discussed. Finally, an example of current research undertaken in geostrophic turbulence will be presented.

<strong>September 16<sup>th</sup>, Movie Night </strong>

<h3>Past Colloquia 2007-2008:</h3>
<strong>April 9th</strong>, Professor Albert Novikoff (Courant)
Tangential Polar Coordinates: A re-discovery and/or a new proof
Abstract:In connection with a 19th century theorem (Holditch’s Theorem) I stumbled on a generalization of plane polar coordinates which is based, in modern terms, on a moving frame (classical polar coordinates, by contrast, use a fixed origin). The corresponding area formula is given a “modern” proof, and generalized to a theorem in three dimensions. Many questions are still unanswered.

<strong>March 5th</strong>, Courant Instructor David Bindel (Courant)
Understanding Resonances
Abstract: Every time we hear a piano or a bell, we observe a resonance. We also use resonances whenever we play with an LED or talk on a cell phone. What is a resonance, and how can we understand resonant systems Mathematicsly? In this talk, I try to answer these questions, at the same time showing a few of the beautiful connections between the theory of resonances and linear algebra, complex analysis, differential equations, and mechanics. I will also share a few examples from one of my favorite applications, microscope mechanical systems that could lead to revolutionary design changes in the next generation of cell phones.

<strong>February 20th</strong>, Professor Charles Peskin (Courant)
Muscle and Blood: Mathematics Modeling and Computer Simulation of the Heart and the Circulation
Abstract: This talk will discuss some examples of Mathematics modeling in cardiovascular physiology. Beginning at the beginning, our first example will be the fetal circulation and how it automatically changes its configuration at and immediately after birth. We also discuss the Mathematics anatomy (differential geometry) of a heart valve, and the fluid dynamics of blood in the cardiac chambers, a problem of fluid-structure interaction. Numerical results will be shown as computer animations of the beating heart.

<strong>February 5th</strong>, Professor Aaron Tenenbein (Stern)
Mathematics Applications in Actuarial Science
Abstract: Actuarial Science is the field that applies Mathematics techniques to problems in the insurance industry. This area is sometimes known as risk management. The talk will discuss some of the problems that actuaries face and the Mathematics techniques that are used to solve these problems. Other topics will involve the courses that will help train actuaries, the professional certification process (examination process) and the career opportunities in the actuarial profession.

<strong>November 15th</strong>, Dean Dan Stein (CAS)
<em>Interdisciplinary Colloquia</em>
The current Dean of Science of CAS, Dean Dan Stein, presented his current research projects and his interdisciplinary approach to education. His research includes noisy non-equilibrium dynamics, disordered and random particles, and biophysics. The event was open to all clubs and members.

<strong>October 23rd</strong>, Professor Robert Kohn (Courant)
What Can You do with a Math Degree?
A degree in mathematics provides a launch pad for many different career paths. Options after graduation include (a) immediate employment, (b) professional masters programs, (c) PhD study in mathematics, (d) PhD study in a related field such as statistics, operations research, or computational science. I will discuss long-term-planning issues (such as how to choose among these options), and also practical issues (such as how to choose a graduate program and maximize your chance of acceptance). This discussion will be useful for students at any stage (not just seniors), since your goals should influence your choice of electives.

<strong>September 18th,</strong> Robert Simione (Undergraduate)
<em>Cost-Benefit Analysis between Voting and Abstaining</em>
A brief look into the cost towards an individual when going through the voting process. Taken from a probability point of view, both voting and abstaining are analyzed, finding which would result in a lower opportunity cost to the voter.

<h3>Past Events 2007-2008:</h3>
<strong>April 30th</strong>, End of the Year Party!
Room 1013, Courant
This was the last meeting of the NYU academic year for Math Club. We brought nice big chocolatey cake, took several pictures, enjoyed many conversations, and--of course--played SET. Thank you all for a great semester and a fantastic year!

<strong>April 23rd</strong>, Elections
Room 1013, Courant
We held elections for the upcoming year of 2008-2009. With several interested and capable candidates, we were able to select a great officer linup for next year by democratic votes. Thank you all for attending and please continue to support the club.

<strong>April 16th</strong>, Math Club Outing
Room 1013, Courant
Several dedicated young and regular Math Club members banded together on a trip to Yalato, where we each picked up our own frozen yogurt, sorbet, or gelato. We all returned to the cozy Courant building to talk about random math and non-math related topics. Overall, we all agreed we should do this once again next semester.

<strong>April 2nd</strong>, "What-Class-Should-I-Take?" Part Deux
Room 1013, Courant
At a week and a half before Registration Week, we assembled the various course experiences from the upperclassmen and had it available in one room for anyone and everyone needing peer advice. This included Mathematics, MAP, and other subject courses. Thank you all for coming and attend next year's event!

<strong>March 13th</strong>, Pi Day Party, 4-8 PM
Room 613, Courant
This was the largest event of the year. We severd a variety of pies, ice cream, and milk. Several of the NYU Math Club members, math majors, and even Cooper Union students enjoyed the party to celebrate the much-loved irrational number, pi. We held a pi recitation contest, and Kevin Cheung won with 28 digits! Congrats! We also watched the spectacular action-packed movie, "300". The Greek letter pi and the Greek Spartans collided, ending the party in a success! Thank you all for supporting us and coming to the event. Enjoy the break.

<strong>February 27th</strong>, Math Club Movie Night Round 2
Room 1013, Courant
Last semester, the Math Club Movie Night (showing "Pi") was a success. So, clearly, we wanted another one. We watched "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" and learned one or two things, such as the simple answer to life, the universe, and everything.

<strong>January 30th</strong>, Math and Art
Room 1013, Courant
At this first meeting of the new semester, we introduced famous math-related artworks by Escher, fractals, and the Mobius strip. We brought out construction paper, crayons and markers, and each member created a Mathematics design or phrase that could be put into the club's T-shirt image. While creating individual artwork, the members introduced themselves, socialized, and enjoyed the wonderful New York style pizza. As expected, the meeting was a blast, and we're looking forward to larger and more enthusiastic meetings!

<strong>December 11th</strong>: Fun Filled Final Fiesta
Room 613, Courant
At this final meeting of the fall semester, we ended on a great note. Not only did we celebrate the end of classes and the semester's rigorous workload, but we also welcomed the new upcoming year. We played games, met new faces, ate ice cream and pizza, and truly enjoyed our last 2007 meeting.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>December 1st</strong>: William Lowell Putnam Exam
Room 102, Courant
On this day, 19 of the bravest undergraduates dared to take the infamous Putnam Exam. After several months of preparation, thanks to the great Professor Sonal Jain and Graduate Student Katrina Bellova, the journey ended with this 6 hour test. We all did our best and are awaiting the results. Results should be out in March. Please check out the Links page to find out what this exam involves and if you want to participate next December.

Students gave back this holiday season to those who are less fortunate.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>November 6th</strong>: What-Class-Should-I-Take? Night
Room 613, Courant
With the confusing list of classes available, underclassmen occasionally need some guidance. At this event, upperclassmen advised and suggested courses which were both enjoyable and educational. Part Deux will be coming this spring semester.

<strong>October 30th</strong>: Math Club Movie Night, Movie: "Pi"
Room 613, Courant
Taking a look at this all-time-classic, we enjoyed the first ever Math Club Movie Night with "Pi". Look forward to the next few showings of other math movies in 2008.<strong>
</strong>

<strong>October 26th</strong>: S.U.R.E. 2007 Presentations
Room 1314, Courant
The Summer Undergraduate Research Experience participants gave their final presentations on their laborious work over the 2007 summer. Each student gave a 10-15 minute talk with Q&amp;A on the field he or she delved into the past few months. Topics ranged from dynamical systems to abstract algebra.

<strong>October 20th</strong>: Mid-Hudson Math Conference for Undergraduates
Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY
Recommended by Professor Richard Pollack of Courant, a group of NYU Math Club members traveled to see this conference. The beautiful and charming scenery and the several talks were captivating.

<strong>October 16th</strong>: First Annual Math Club Mixer or Party or Something
Room 613, Courant
As the event name implies, the members of Math Club got to know each other. We introduced ourselves to the group and played games and ate food. If you were not able to attend, look forward to the upcoming parties of 2008!

<strong>September 25th</strong>: Game Night
Room 614, Courant
<h3>Past Colloquia from 2005:</h3>
There is an international projecto to develop thermonuclear reactors that employ magnetic fusion of hydrogen into helium as it occurs in the stars. Mathematcial models and computer codes being applied to this problem at NYU will be described.

<strong>April 28th</strong>, Professor Dodis (Courant)
<em>Zero-knowledge Cryptography</em>
I will give a brief introduction to zero-knowledge proofs. Such proof allow one to prove the validity of some assertion without leaking any information beyond the fact the assertion is valid. For example, we will see how to prove to a blind person that color exist, without giving him any clue "WHAT HAPPEN:". More Mathematicsly, we will prove that a graph has a hamiltonian cycle without giving away anything about the actual cycle! Or that one knows how to decrypt a message, without giving any information about the decryption!

<strong>April 14th</strong>, Alex Barnett (Courant Instructor)
<em>Drums and Quantum Chaos</em>
Abstract: Finding the normal modes of an elastic membrane stretched across a rigid frame of a given shape is known as the 'drum problem'. These modes are given by eigenfunctions of the Laplacian operator with certain boundary conditions. At high frequencies the wavelength becomes short compared to the size of the drum, and new `semiclassical' phenomena emerge. I will discuss the ray quantization of Einstein-Brillouin-Keller, and `quantum chaos' which results from chaotic ray dynamics. I will overview simple numerical methods for the solution of these modes at high frequency, and discuss applications to electromagnetics, optics (laser cavity design), and quantum physics.

<strong>March 24th</strong>: Professor Ben Arous (Courant)
<em>Random Matrices</em>: A First Introduction
I will give a gentle introduction to the following question: what is the typical spectrum of a large hermitian matrix chosen at random? I will explain briefly how this question arose historically in statistics and physics, and the more recently established links with some combinatorics questions.

<strong>March 4th</strong>: Professor Esteban Tabak (Courant)
<em>Internal Waves in the Atmosphere and Ocean</em>
Unlike the familiar surface waves at the interface betweenwater and air, most of the waves that surround us are invisible, since they consist of oscillations of layers of air (in the atmosphere) or water (in the ocean) of slightly different density, yet identical color. These "internal waves", however, are much more relevant to the climate than surface waves.In this talk, we'll explore the Mathematics and physical structure of the internal wave field, which includes a number of significant open problems.

<strong>February 24th</strong>: Professor Ben Arous (Courant)
<em>Randomly Walking on the Hypercube</em>
This talk will introduce the topic of random walks and Markov Chains, through the example of the random walk on the hypercube. Almost no prerequisites are needed.

<strong>February 10th</strong>: Professor Jon Kettenring (Drew University)
<em>The Practice of Cluster Analysis</em>
Cluster analysis is one of the main methodologies for analyzing multivariate statistical data. While not as neat and tidy as other methods, its use is widespread and growing rapidly. The goal of the talk will be to introduce cluster analysis, document its growth, provide several examples of recent applications, and highlight both good and risky practices. It will conclude with suggestions for how the current practice of clusters could be improved. No background in statistics will be presumed for this talk.

<strong>February 3rd</strong>: Professor Charles Peskin (Courant)
<em>Muscle and Blood: Mathematics Modeling and Computer Simulation of the Beating Heart</em>
The mechanics of the heart involves the interaction of the muscular heart walls, the flexible heart valve leaflets, and the blood that flows in the cardiac chambers. This talk will describe a Mathematics formulation and computational method for such problems of

<strong>December 2</strong>: Professor Sylvain Cappell (Courant)
<em>Classification of Manifolds</em>
A classification theory for manifolds is a 'holy grail' of mathemaitcs. This was achieved for two-dimensional manifolds in the 19th century. An approach called "surgery theory," beginning in the 1960s, has produced great results in higher dimensions (5 and up). Techniques from Mathematics physics have in the last 25 years led to progress in dimension 4. We will survey how diferent dimensions lead to different approached. Each with their own flavor.

<strong>November 18</strong>: Professor Richard Pollack (Courant)
<em>Problems in Discrete Geometry</em>
There are a lot of fun and deep problems that arise in Discrete Geometry, the solutions of which are very elegant. Professor Pollack is going to describe of few of them: Sylvester's problem, Vincensini's problem (which has no solution), Helly's theorem, Hadwiger's theorem and some others if time remains. There are absolutely no prerequisites for this lecture beyond high school geometry.

<strong>November 4</strong>: Professor Kit Fine (Philosophy Dept.)
<em>The Continuum Hypothesis</em>
In the late 1800s Georg Cantor devised a way of relating infinite sets by trying to find a one-to-one and onto correspondence (or bijection) between them. For example, the size (or cardinality) of the set of integers is equal to the size of the set of rational numbers, because, surprisingly, it is possible to create a bijection between them. However, no bijection exists between the set of integers and real numbers. You might ask, is there a set whose cardinality lies between the integers/rationals and real numbers (the continuum)? The answer: nobody knows!
In 1936, Kurt Godel (famous for his incompleteness theorem) proved that the continuum hypothesis (i.e., there are no sets with cardinality lying between the integers and real numbers) is consistent with our standard axioms of set theory. In 1964, Paul Cohen proved that the negation of the continuum hypothesis is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory. So the continuum hypothesis is somehow both true and false, or neither true nor false; its verifiability cannot be decided upon unless we introduce new axioms.

<strong>October 26th</strong>, Professor Childress (Courant)
<em>Flapping Flight</em>
Discussion of some of the fluid dynamics of flapping flight of birds and insests, both forward and hovering flight, and contrasting this with mechanisms of propulsion by micro-organisms. The transition to flapping flight will be discussed in the light of observations of a small marine pteropod possessing both cilia and wings. The principles will be illustrated through experiments performed in the Courant Institute's Applied Mathematics Laboratory.

<strong>November 9th</strong>, Professor Garabedian (Courant)

<strong>April 26th</strong>: Rm. 513
<em>Graduate School and Other Opportunities for Math Majors</em>
We're going to have an interactive talk on applying to graduate schools and other avenues of exploration for math majors after college. There will be a few people to give you their perspectives: Tamar Arnon, Professor Varadhan, Jean Steiner and a graduate student. Tamar is the Assistant Director of Student Affairs for the graduate school, and while she doesn't make admission decisions, she sits in on many of the discussions that do, and does see and organize the applications. Professor Varadhan is a member of the fellowship committee, and is one of the faculty who makes decisions regarding admissions. Jean Steiner is a post-doc student who'll talk about other possibilities for math majors besides more school.
<h3>Past Events from 2004 and Prior</h3>
<h3>Monday, September 15th 2003, 7:00 PM: First Math Club Meeting, and "The Subway Problem"</h3>
<h4>Professor Joseph Bak (City College)</h4>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1314

This talk will be concerned with the problem of finding a way to make the most possible room for everybody in a limited space. The talk includes applications of the pigeon-hole principle, the method of variations, and a way to define fractional and even irrational dimensions. Only high-school mathematics is required, so don't be intimidated by the preceeding sentance.
<h3>Thursday, April 24th, 7:00 PM: Traffic Modeling</h3>
<h4>Professor Esteban Tabak</h4>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1314

Looked from afar, cars moving on roads resemble water flowing through rivers or pipes. This analogy goes deep into the Mathematics structure of the models describing traffic and fluid flow. This talk will describe some such models, and use them both to understand real life situations, such as the congestion waves we often experience on highways, and to develop an appreciation of the mathematics of fluid flow.
<h3>Thursday, April 3rd, 6:30PM: Rubik's Cube</h3>
<h4>Professor Mel Hausner</h4>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1314

A discussion of Rubik's cube and it's relationship to elementary group theory. No prior knowledge is required. During the course of this lecture, you will see Professor Hausner reassemble a Rubik's cube into it's original pure state (with explanations). Possibly, he will fail and be mortified. In either case, expect a great talk! Bring your own cube if you have one.
<div>Check out <a href="http://www.rubiks.com/">Rubik's Online</a> and their <a href="http://www.rubiks.com/cubesolutionother.html">cube solutions</a> page.</div>
<h3>Thursday, January 30th, 7:00 PM: Introduction to Knot Theory</h3>
<h4>Professor Sylvain Cappell</h4>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1314

For about two hundred years mathematicians have been developing a great variety of approaches to finding invariants of knots and links, with a hope of someday using these to achieve a classification. I will briefly discuss some old and new invariants and their roles, geometrical interpretations and applications.
<h3>Friday, December 6th, 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM: VIGRE Summer Research</h3>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1302

About 14 people did summer research under NYU's VIGRE grant last summer and they gave brief talks on what they did at this meeting. Also, there was something of a social outing afterwards.
<h3>Sunday, November 24th: Natural History Museum</h3>
The math club funded a trip to the Natural History Museum to see the special exhibit on Albert Einstein.
<h3>Thursday, October 24th, 7:00 PM: Applying to Graduate School</h3>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1302

Tamar Anon and Professor Varadhan, as well as two first year Courant graduate students, will join us to discuss applying to math graduate schools. While Tamar Anon does not make admissions decisions, she sits in on many of the discussions that do, and does see and organize the applications. Professor Varadhan is one of the faculty members who does make decisions regarding admissions.
<h3>Thursday, October 3, 7:00 PM: Surprises in the Global Greenhouse?</h3>
<h4>Professor David Holland</h4>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 1302

There exists ample evidence that the climatic state of our planet has undergone dramatic change in the recent past. Such changes include both cooler and warmer air temperatures and oscillations in global sea level of more than 100 meters. Over the last few decades, scientific attention and concern have been drawn to the possible impact that humankind may be exerting on the climate system -- most notably through the influence of greenhouse gases. In response to this concern, numerical models of the climate system have been created and used to make projections of the climate for this century. These complex models are based on the application of Mathematics and computational techniques to fundamental physical laws. In this talk, a major shortcoming of these models is examined, namely their representation of the Antarctic ice sheet -- the single largest reservoir of freshwater on earth. This ice sheet could partially or totally collapse under the stress of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases. The future behavior of this ice sheet thus represents a wild card in the evolution of the climate. It also presents an exciting and challenging opportunity for innovation and application of Mathematics and computational techniques.

<h3>Wednesday, September 25, 1:15 PM: Organizational meeting</h3>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 613
<h3>Friday, September 13, 1:00 PM: Primality testing after Agrawal, Kayal and Saxen</h3>
Warren Weaver Hall Room 101

The problem of whether it is possible to tell quickly if a large number is prime has stood open for a long time. Recently two Indian undergraduate students along with their professor showed that it is possible. We will explain their elementary and ingeneous algorithm.
