# Mathematics Competitions and Events

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## William Lowell Putnam Exam ##

* [General Info/Main Site](http://math.scu.edu/putnam/)

		The examination will be constructed to test originality as well as
		technical competence. It is expected that the contestant will be
		familiar with the formal theories embodied in undergraduate
		mathematics. It is assumed that such training, designed for mathematics
		and physical science majors, will include somewhat more sophisticated
		mathematical concepts than is the case in minimal courses. Thus the
		differential equations course is presumed to include some references to
		qualitative existence theorems and subtleties beyond the routine
		solution devices. Questions will be included that cut across the bounds
		of various disciplines, and self-contained questions that do not fit
		into any of the usual categories may be included. It will be assumed
		that the contestant has acquired a familiarity with the body of
		mathematical lore commonly discussed in mathematics clubs or in courses
		with such titles as “survey of the foundations of mathematics.”It is
		also expected that the self-contained questions involving elementary
		concepts from group theory, set theory, graph theory, lattice theory,
		number theory, and cardinal arithmetic will not be entirely foreign to
		the contestant’s experience."

## Mathematics Contest in Modeling ##

* [MCM & ICM Contests](http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/)

		MCM is a contest where teams of undergraduates use mathematical modeling
		to present their solutions to real world problems. MCM will take place
		February 6 - February 10, 2014 . Advisors can register teams online
		now. Note that we have made a number of changes in the contest policy
		and registration process since last year; all advisors should read the
		registration instructions and contest rules thoroughly.

## Brown SUMS ##

* [March 8th 2008](http://math.brown.edu/SUMS/)

        The Brown University Symposium for Undergraduates in the
        Mathematical Sciences (SUMS) has been held annually
        since 2002. The symposium's goal is to foster greater
        undergraduate interest and scholarship in mathematics by
        demonstrating the ubiquity of mathematics throughout the
        sciences. The conference also provides an environment in which
        motivated undergraduates can come together to share their own
        work and learn from distinguished faculty and researchers fro
        around the country.
		
        This year's symposium will be held on April 5th, 2014 in Barus
		& Holley 167/168, 184 Hope Street, Providence, and features the
        topic of Visualizing Mathematics
		
## cSplash ##

* [March 29th 2008](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~csplash/index.php)

        Courant Splash, or cSplash, is an annual one-day lecture series taught by enthusiastic students, 
        faculty, and others associated with the Courant Institute of New York University. Since 2006,
        cSplash has been providing a meeting ground for mathematically inclined students in the New York
        metropolitan area, exposing them to the beauty, utility, and ubiquity of mathematical ideas. Have a 
        look at our past talks, designed and delivered by our passionate instructors. And the pictures, too,
        getting here lest you believe there's no fun in mathematics!
