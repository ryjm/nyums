Our Activities
==============

\`NYU Mathematics Society Facebook

We provide our members with extensive sources of interaction with
mathematics, and it is a great way to meet your fellow peers.

### Faculty Colloquia

We hold informal colloquia most Thursdays which vary from philosophical
mathematical topics to applied mathematics where Courant Institute
Professors / PhD students present their research. These events are great
opportunities to learn about the different branches of mathematics, to
know the Courant faculty, and to prepare for your own research.

### Math-themed Events

We hold special math-themed events and make excursions to conferences
and symposia near the New York City area. We organize various events
such as trips in and out of the New York area, including Brown SUMS; and
festive meetings, such as NYU Annual Pi Day Party and math-themed Movie
/ Game Night. Please see our [Events](http://math.nyu.edu/events,)
section for more details on our past colloquia and events.

### Math Lounge (Currently in limb0)

Most mathematics is learned outside the classroom. We provide an
environment that both stimulates learning and directs it. Everyone is
welcome to visit the Math Lounge in Room 1103, Warren Weaver Hall
(Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences). It is a great place to
study and socialize. There are two computers with internet access, a
printer, Ethernet cables for Notebooks/Netbooks to access the internet,
a couch, and a blackboard for discussions about math or justabout
everything else. [Google Map of Warren Weaver Hall, Courant Institute of
