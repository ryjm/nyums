<h2>Our Activities</h2>
We provide our members with extensive sources of interaction with mathematics, and it is a great way to meet your fellow peers.

<strong><em>Faculty Colloquia</em></strong>

We hold informal colloquia most Thursdays which vary from philosophical mathematical topics to applied mathematics where Courant Institute Professors / PhD students present their research. These events are great opportunities to learn about the different branches of mathematics, to know the Courant faculty, and to prepare for your own research.

<strong><em>Math-themed Events</em></strong>

&nbsp;

We hold special math-themed events and make excursions to conferences and symposia near the New York City area. We organize various events such as trips in and out of the New York area, including Brown SUMS; and festive meetings, such as NYU's Annual Pi Day Party and math-themed Movie / Game Night.

Please see our <a title="Calendar" href="http://localhost:8888/trunk/?page_id=15" target="_blank">Calendar </a>section or our <a title="Archives" href="http://localhost:8888/trunk/?page_id=7" target="_blank">Archives </a>section for more details on our past colloquia and events.

<strong><em>Math Lounge (Currently in limb0)</em></strong>

&nbsp;

Most mathematics is learned outside the classroom. We provide an environment that both stimulates learning and directs it. Everyone is welcome to visit the Math Lounge in Room 1103, Warren Weaver Hall (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences).

It's a great place to study and socialize. There are two computers with internet access ,a printer, Ethernet cables for Notebooks/Netbooks to access the internet, a couch, and a blackboard for discussions about math or justabout everything else.
