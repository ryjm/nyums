## Lecture - Professor Cappell - Manifolds

Join us this Thursday for an amazing introduction to these beautiful and ubiquitous mathematical objects by the world-renowned topologist
Sylvain Cappell.

Title: "What's a manifold, and how many are out there?"
Speaker: Sylvain Cappell (Silver Professor of Mathematics at NYU)
Location: 201 WWH
Time: Thursday, April 11th @ 7:15pm 

Food & drinks will be plentiful, and you have a say in what's offered! Click to Vote on Refreshments.

Dear bewildered souls and impassioned minds,

How do you approach mathematics?
Is mathematics just a collection of definitions and theorems?
Can we discover deep mathematical truths by attempting to solve puzzles?

## Puzzles!

Join us tomorrow (4/4) at 7:15pm in 201 WWH for an informal gathering of puzzle-posers and puzzle-solvers. Try your hand at some of the
problems compiled in Dartmouth mathematician Peter Winkler's book. Many of these puzzles (some unsolved) present difficult questions in
mathematics in easy-to-understand ways. Food will be plentiful.

For a taste, try these puzzles on for size (warning - many have counter-intuitive answers!):

1) Can you pass a cube through a hole in a smaller cube?

2) The projections of a solid body onto two planes are perfect disks. Prove that they have the same radius.

3) A two-headed coin, a two-tailed coin, and an ordinary coin are put in a bag. A coin is randomly drawn from the bag and flipped. If the coin
lands on heads, what's the probability the other side of coin is also heads? (Hint: the answer is not 1/2)

Peace and Love,
NYU Mathematics Society

P.S. Mathematics is inspirational!

Hopefully your minds are sharp as ever after spring break, because the Mathematics Society has something cool in store for you all.

## Bren Cavallo - Crypto Lecture

This Thursday, March 28th, Bren Cavallo from the CUNY Graduate Center will be making the journey downtown to NYU to deliver a talk entitled "Perfectly Secret
Encryption". The talk will be in CIWW 201 at 7:15pm. A bounty of delicious food will be provided, of course.

The talk will be accessible to those who haven't seen any cryptography before, and the speaker will be more than happy to address individual questions. 

See you all there!

## 1. CSplash Info. Session

The president of CSplash, Mark H. Kim, will give a talk about CSplash, explaining what it is, etc.  In additon, he is seeking volunteers or teachers who are willing to particiapte in CSplash.  If you are interested, come prepared with questions to ask about this event!

## 2. Diversity Chair Election

We will be holding an election for Diveristy Chair.  There are 6 candidates for the position.  The election provess will consist of: 1) Each candidate giving a 2 minute speech and 2) Their previously written personal statements will be projected on the screen for everyone to see.  Voting will occur after each candidate has given their speech.  Further instruction will be given the day of election.  

## 3. Brown Sums Conference Trip Sign-up

The Brown Sums Conference is on March 9, 2013. If you would like to attend, please sign up by Thursday, Februray 28th, 2013 at the latest.  (This is solely a recommendation given that if you attend you will be rooming with Brown students and it takes time to pair up host students and yourself)  Last year we travelled on Friday, attending the conference on Saturday, and returend on Sunday thus staying overnight two nights.  Once you register for the conference, please send an email John Yoon, the Vice President of NYUMS, at jyoon0529@gmail.com, so we can have a count of the number of people attending.
The website for registration is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFEyeXdSdlJVMFN5T3JldkpNVnFwelE6MQ#gid=0. It takes less than 5 minutes to fill out the registration form. 
We will have Brown Sums Conference Trip meeting on Thursday, March 7, 2013at 7:15 PM (our regular NYUMS meeting time) for those of you who signed up.

## Lecture Talk!

A polygon tessellates the plane if rotations and translations of that polygon can cover the plane without overlaps or gaps.  Every triangle tessellates, and every quadrilateral (even the non-convex ones).  Not every pentagon tessellates, but some do, and we wonder how many similarity types of tessellating pentagons exist.  Before 1968 it was thought to be five, but over the next 20 years several more were found, including four by an amateur with only a high school math education.

We hope that you all enjoyed last week's introductory meeting! This week we will be having a meeting to discuss the Brown Sums Conference and we are also looking to elect someone for the Diversity Chair position.
