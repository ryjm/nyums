3. Brown Sums Conference Trip Sign-up

The Brown Sums Conference is on March 9, 2013. If you would like to attend, please sign up by Thursday, Februray 28th, 2013 at the latest.  (This is solely a recommendation given that if you attend you will be rooming with Brown students and it takes time to pair up host students and yourself)  Last year we travelled on Friday, attending the conference on Saturday, and returend on Sunday thus staying overnight two nights.  Once you register for the conference, please send an email John Yoon, the Vice President of NYUMS, at jyoon0529@gmail.com, so we can have a count of the number of people attending.
The website for registration is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFEyeXdSdlJVMFN5T3JldkpNVnFwelE6MQ#gid=0. It takes less than 5 minutes to fill out the registration form. 
We will have Brown Sums Conference Trip meeting on Thursday, March 7, 2013at 7:15 PM (our regular NYUMS meeting time) for those of you who signed up.

Lecture Talk!

A polygon tessellates the plane if rotations and translations of that polygon can cover the plane without overlaps or gaps.  Every triangle tessellates, and every quadrilateral (even the non-convex ones).  Not every pentagon tessellates, but some do, and we wonder how many similarity types of tessellating pentagons exist.  Before 1968 it was thought to be five, but over the next 20 years several more were found, including four by an amateur with only a high school math education.
