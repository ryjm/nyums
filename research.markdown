### Getting advice from Courant Institute Faculty:

The best source of advice about your career in mathematics is to ask one
of your professors. Many faculty in the [Courant
Institute](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/) have affiliations with other
academic or private institutions. Undergraduates can also contact
Beth Markowitz, the Undergraduate Program Administrator by emailing
her at [beth(at)cims.nyu.edu](mailto:beth@cims.nyu.edu) or visiting
her in Room 626 in Warren Weaver Hall, Courant Institute of Mathematical
Sciences.

### Undergraduate Research Opportunities:

Our club assists students doing research.  Further information is available on
the various web pages maintained by the **American Mathematics Society**
([AMS](http://www.ams.org/)), in the
[Careers and Education](http://www.ams.org/profession/profession) section. We encourage
students to explore further for information and opportunities not mentioned
here.

### EDGE

The Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education
([EDGE](http://www.edgeforwomen.org/)) program, funded by
The [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/) and
the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.org/), is designed to
strengthen the ability of women and minority students to successfully
complete graduate programs in the Mathematics sciences. The summer
program consists of two core courses in analysis and algebra/linear
algebra. There will also be minicourses in vital areas of Mathematics
research in pure and applied mathematics, short-term visitors from
academia and industry, guest lectures, graduate student mentors, and
problem sessions. In addition, a follow-up mentoring program and support
network will be established with the participants' respective graduate
programs.

### MASS

The **Mathematics Advanced Study
Semesters** ([MASS](http://www.math.psu.edu/mass/)) program at
the [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu/)seeks to provide
students with a comprehensive environment for the study of mathematics.
The program's core consists of courses chosen from areas in Algebra,
Number Theory, Analysis, Geometry, and Topology, each of which are
specially designed for MASS participants. In addition, students
participate in weekly interdisciplinary MASS seminars and
colloquium-type lectures given by visiting and resident mathematicians.
Seniors, juniors or sophomores enrolled in U.S. colleges and
universities may apply for admission to the program.

### Math in Moscow

The **Independent University of
Moscow** ([IUM](http://ium.mccme.ru/english/)), a global centre for
the study of mathematics, offers a 15-week academic program for foreign
undergraduate and graduate students of mathematics or computer science.
Students participating in the [Math in
Moscow](http://www.mccme.ru/mathinmoscow/) program may choose
as many courses as desired from a wide range of mathematics courses. All
courses are taught in English.

### NIH

The **National Institutes of Health** ([NIH](http://www.nih.gov/)), the
country's largest national biomedical research facility, offer an
eight-week [summer
internship](http://www.training.nih.gov/) program
at the main campus in Bethesda, MD. Students, who must be U.S. citizens
or permanent residents, will join laboratories in one of the twenty-one
Institutes and departments, where they will participate in ongoing
research projects. Of particular interest is the **Mathematics Research
Branch** ([MRB](http://mrb.niddk.nih.gov/)) of the **National Institute
of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney
Diseases** ([NIDDK](http://www.niddk.nih.gov/)), a center for
theoretical and modeling studies in biology.

### REU

Recognizing the importance of undergraduate research opportunites in
promoting basic research,the National Science Foundation founded
the **Research Opportunities for
Undergraduates** ([REU](http://www.nsf.gov/home/crssprgm/reu/reulist.htm))
grant program. The programs are held at various instiutions across the
country, and range from Biology and Physical sciences to Education and
Economics.

### VIGRE (Outdated)

In 1998, the [National Science
Foundation](http://www.nsf.org/) inaugurated a series of grants
for **Vertical Integration of Graduate Research and Education in the
Mathematics Sciences** ([VIGRE](http://www.math.psu.edu/VIGRE/)). These
grants provide funding for both graduate and undergraduate research
programs over the summer and during the year. As of September 2001, more
than thirty institutions have been awarded VIGRE funding,
including [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu/). The variety of activities being
pursued under the VIGRE program can be seen from their web sites.
