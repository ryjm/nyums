Aloha Comrades!

Hopefully your minds are sharp as ever after spring break, because the Mathematics Society has something cool in store for you all.

This Thursday, March 28th, Bren Cavallo from the CUNY Graduate Center will be making the journey downtown to NYU to deliver a talk entitled "Perfectly Secret
Encryption". The talk will be in CIWW 201 at 7:15pm. A bounty of delicious food will be provided, of course.

The talk will be accessible to those who haven't seen any cryptography before, and the speaker will be more than happy to address individual questions. 

See you all there!
