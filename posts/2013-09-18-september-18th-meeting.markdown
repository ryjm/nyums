-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a pleasure meeting all of you last week! For this week's meeting we
will be having a puzzle night. We'll have some fun but interesting math
puzzles for you to try your hand at. Some of them have solutions that
motivate more advances topics that we can talk about. Bring your best
puzzles and riddles to share! There are a few to hold you over below. The
last one is especially nice.

When: Wednesday, September 18th @ 5:30pm
Where: Warren Weaver Hall room 1314
What: Puzzle night!

---------

Suppose you're on a game show and you have a choice of three doors. Behind
door 1 lies a check that will pay for all 4 years at NYU. Behind the other
two doors lie goats. You pick one of the three doors, but before you find
out whether your parents will have to mortgage their house, the host opens
one of the other doors that reveals a goat. He says that you can either
stick with your original door or change to the remaining door. Should you
switch or not, or does it not matter?

---------

A group of math majors with assorted eye colors barricade themselves in
Bobst to study for finals. They are all perfect logicians -- if a
conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one
knows the color of their own eyes. Every night at midnight, anyone who
knows the color of their own eyes suffers a nervous breakdown and has to
leave. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the
number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but
they cannot otherwise communicate. All the math majors know these rules.

There are 100 blue-eyed math majors, 100 brown-eyed math majors, and a
single person with green eyes. So any given blue-eyed person can see 100
people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes and one with green, but
that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals
could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have
red eyes.

One day, the person with green eyes says a single sentence:
"I can see someone who has blue eyes."

Who leaves the island, and on what night?

---------

Two integers x and y are selected such that 1 < x <= y < 100.

A giraffe is given the product x*y and a Turkey is given the sum x+y.

The following dialogue takes place:

Giraffe: I don’t know the values x and y.
Turkey: I knew you didn’t know. I don’t know them either.
Giraffe: Now I know x and y.
Turkey: Now I know them too.

What are x and y?
