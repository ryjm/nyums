Hi everybody!
 
You all seemed to enjoy Professor Cappell's talk last week! It was pretty good, huh?

I hope you are yet more inspired to explore the wonders of mathematics.
But how can you navigate through the myriad courses offered at NYU? 

You're in luck! This week, we'll be hosting a course advisement session led by Professor
Matthew Leingang.
Pizza and good vibes will be plentiful.

2. SOME HIGH SCHOOL KID'S SURVEY

This high school kid is doing a research project. Help him out, if you feel like it.

        My name is Jhumpa Rani Sarkar and I am a student at Townsend Harris High School in
        Queens, NY. I am currently enrolled in a social science research class. I am
        developing a research project for the Quality of Life and INTEL research
        competitions. My research project is on bottled water consumption and peopleâ€™s
        preferences on bottled and tap water. The survey will require around 5-10 minutes
        for participation. (People have to be 18 years or older) 

Link for the survey: tinyurl.com/thhsbottles

(Latest you can respond is midnight of this Thursday.)

NYUMS
