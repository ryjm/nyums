Hi Everyone,

Lecture Talk

Brown SUMS Conference

Lecture Talk
WHEN: THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 21th, 7:15 PM WHERE: WWH (Warren Weaver Hall) ROOM 201 

WHAT: A polygon tessellates the plane if rotations and translations of that polygon can cover the plane without overlaps or gaps.  Every triangle tessellates, and every quadrilateral (even the non-convex ones).  Not every pentagon tessellates, but some do, and we wonder how many similarity types of tessellating pentagons exist.  Before 1968 it was thought to be five, but over the next 20 years several more were found, including four by an amateur with only a high school math education.

Brown SUMS Conference
WHAT: On March 9th 2013, Brown is hosting the Symposium for Undergraduates in the Mathematics Sciences (SUMS). A group of us are planning to go to this symposium and see all the cool mathematics there. If you’d like to come with us, we'd love to have you!
